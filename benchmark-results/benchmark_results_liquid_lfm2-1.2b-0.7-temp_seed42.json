However, the score is not low enough to trigger the exclusion based on rules 7 and 8, which specifically prohibit inventing new reasons or placing explanations outside the email content.",

The inclusion of an email address from a generic domain (barrster samson stephen esq. ) and an unusual name (Barrister Samson Stephen) also raises red flags.",

The promise of 50% and 40% share of the $15 million proceeds, along with a detailed plan that includes tracing the last name over the internet, suggests a high level of intent to deceive. Additionally, the offer to pay 10% of the proceeds as expenses further complicates the legitimacy of the request."
