We will use this dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset

## Project Goals

Initially this will be for testing/benchmarking purposes however future development could involve fine tuning or using RAG to create a model that is better at figuring out what is a phising email.

## Dataset Information

### Source
- **Platform**: Kaggle
- **Dataset Name**: Phishing Email Dataset
- **Creator**: naserabdullahalam
- **URL**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset

### Dataset Overview
This dataset was compiled by researchers to study phishing email tactics. It combines emails from a variety of sources to create a comprehensive resource for analysis. The dataset contains email samples labeled as phishing or legitimate emails, designed for training and evaluating machine learning models to detect phishing attempts.

### Typical Dataset Characteristics (to be verified after download)
- **Format**: Likely CSV or JSON containing email content and labels
- **Features**: May include:
  - Email subject lines
  - Email body content
  - Sender information
  - URLs/links within emails
  - Labels (phishing/legitimate)
- **Size**: To be determined after dataset download
- **Class Distribution**: To be analyzed (phishing vs legitimate email ratio)

### Use Cases
1. **Testing/Benchmarking**: Evaluate model performance on phishing detection
2. **Fine-tuning**: Train models specifically for phishing email detection
3. **RAG Implementation**: Use dataset for retrieval-augmented generation to improve phishing detection accuracy

### Next Steps
- Download and explore the dataset structure
- Analyze data distribution and quality
- Identify feature engineering opportunities
- Prepare data for model training/testing
